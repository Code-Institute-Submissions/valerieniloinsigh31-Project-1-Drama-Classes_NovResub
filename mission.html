        <h4><b><em>Joanne Downey's Qualifications</em></b> <i class="fa-solid fa-graduation-cap"></i></h4>
        <hr>

        Having developed a love for the stage whilst fulfilling her role as debating captain of 'Clonakilty Community School' through her tweens and teens, Joanne
        Downey knew a career in performance was for her.
        
        Without resources/classes at her disposal, Joanne worked tirelessly to keep informed about the Irish theatre scene and constantly 
        refined her skills by learning new monologues and audition pieces.
        
        She decided to pursue a B.A. Hons in 'Drama and Theatre Studies' from Trinity College, Dublin and was successful in her application.
        She specialised in Advanced Writing, receiving a first in this module and her writing was presented in the prestigious <em>Samuel
        Beckett Theatre</em>.

        During her time in Trinity, she also specialised in acting, directing and applied theatre. She was a very active member of the student society, where
        she wrote, directed and acted in a number of shows.

        Following her primary degree, she went on to complete an MFA in Playwriting in <em>The Lir Academy</em>.

        She was lucky enough to rub shoulders with excellent performers, creatives and deisgners from all over the globe, including
        the majority of the cast of Irish television series, "Normal People"

        <h4><em>Joanne Downey's Experience</em>  <i class="fa-solid fa-briefcase"></i></h4>

        During her summers at University, Joanne worked as the Head of Department at a Performing Arts Camp in Upstate New York, where she devised a programme 
        for the campers that operated in tandem with the main camp (wherein six major musicals and plays were shown). Her curriculum
        was devised incorporating stand-up comedy, improvisation, sketch comedy writing and drama (monologue/duologue performance).

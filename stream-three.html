    <h1>Stream Three</h1>
    <p>Innovative new class offerings for tweens (9-12yo) and teens (13-16yo) in the scenic rural surroundings of Clonakilty, West Cork.
        Open to locals and blow-ins alike.

        Class frequency, times and class sizes can be arranged at discretion-please see '' section and specify accordingly in the 'SignUp Form section'  
        Offered to girls and boys alike, there will be something for everybody. 
        
        The classes are offered by highly qualified, intensely experienced Drama graduate, performer, writer, facilitator and practitioner, 
        <em>Joanne Downey</em>, who recently graduated with honors from Trinity College, Dublin with a B.A. Hons in 'Drama and Theatre Studies'. 
        Please see her own body of work advertised on her personal website (hyperlink). The proof is in the pudding after all.

        After spending her summers in Upstate New York at 'Stars of the Future Inc.', facilitating this very same age group (9-16yo) of children in a variety 
        of different performance styles, Joanne feels that it is finally time to start fostering the talent in the locality arranged
        to apply her expertise.
        
        The classes, which will be on offer both individually and in groups, will include improvisation (short form and long form), stand-up comedy, 
        sketch-writing, acting (monologue and duologue) and emceeing classes.

        Whether you're a parent of a tween or teen with spare time or a passion for drama, with a desire to perform or simply to grow in confidence,
        there is truly something for everybody on offer with 'Pure Drama.'

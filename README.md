PURE DRAMA FOR TWEENS AND TEENS

This section is 1/2 paragraphs providing an overview of the project. Sales pitch.

-What the project hopes to accomplish. The project should successfully display what is on offer with the classes (content/format), describe who the facilitator/teacher is and what their experience is and describe the format of the end-of-term shows and what the students could aim to participate in. Also different payment structures and means of payment should be described as well as the location of the classes and show (in the local Commnuity Hall). It should be revealed how the classes can be offered one-on-one or to groups, what times are available and what level of commitment is required.
-Who the project is targetting.
The project is targetting the parents of tweens and teens as well as the tweens and teens in the locality who are looking to make better use of their spare time or to experiment with different styles of performance (comedy, stand up, imrpoviation, monologe, duologue, mc etc.) The classes are suitable for those who wish to perform in the end of term show, which will be open for the attendance of the general public but equally suitable to those who do not wish to perform at all or who simply want to attend on a casual basis/to gain confidence in their own lives. Potentially an alternative to locals who do not have an interest in the vibrant sports scene and wish to have a different social outlet. Also suitable for those who wish to write material for others as opposed to performing themselves. As this will be the inaugural year of the project, with the founder and facilitator, Bernie O'Hara havign recently graduated with honors from a degree in Threatre in 'Trinity College, Dublin', and due to initial lack of funding, efforts will be expected from the town to contribute to the sucess of the show.
-How it will be useful to a target audience.
The website will be useful in conveying potential and what is possible to people of the town. The landing page will have some key information about target group, price and commitment required to succeed. It will describe the suggested format of the classes, which is adaptable. It will provided alternative locations and times as well as a brief intro video from the teacher showcasing some of her students/past work/show reel, with her introducing how she plans on strutcuring the term. There will be a naviagtion section that leads to two other pages (Gallery and Sign-Up page).

The gallery will showcase the location/space on offer for the classes as well as the stage/hall area where the end of term showcase will take place. It will also show photos of different performance styles, with hyperlinks included underneath that provided further information (stand-up comedy, commedia dell arte, improvisation, emceeing, duologues and monologue performance)

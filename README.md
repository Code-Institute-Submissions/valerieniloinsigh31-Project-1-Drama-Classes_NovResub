<h1>PURE DRAMA FOR TWEENS AND TEENS</h1>

<h2><em>Provisional Introduction</em><h2>

<h3><b>-What the project hopes to accomplish.</b></h3>
 <p>The aim of the website is to advertise newly launched performance-based classes for tweens and teens in Clonakilty. The website is in association with 'Pure Drama Limited', a newly establised company of the facilitator/website owner in question, Joanne Downey. Having graduated with an Honors degree in 'Drama and Theatre Studies' and an MFA in Playwriting, Joanne has launched her own company 'Pure Drama' with her husband, Michael Downey and the pair are launching classes in their native town of Clonakilty The website should successfully display what is on offer with the classes (content/format), describe who the facilitator/teacher is as well outline the mission of the newly established company and describe what their relevant experience/qualifications are. The site should also indicate towards the format of the end-of-term shows and highlight how the cast/crew will be sourced from the classes but that it is not mandatory for the people in the class to participate in the show. The content and location of the classes should be presented. With the design, it should be concisely outlined how the classes can be offered one-on-one or to groups, what times are available and what will be involved with the classes. There will be an interactive, responsive page also which allows the user of the website to input their details and preferences.</p>

<h3><b>Who the project is targetting.</b></h3>

<p>The project is targetting the parents of tweens and teens, as well as the tweens and teens in the locality who are looking to make better use of their spare time or to experiment with different styles of performance (comedy, stand up, improvisation, monologe, duologue, hosting etc.) The classes are suitable for those who wish to perform in the end of term show, which will be open for the attendance of the general public but equally suitable to those who do not wish to perform at all and who simply want to attend on a casual basis/to gain confidence in their own lives and this should be conveyed in the website. Potentially, the classes could offer an alternative to locals who do not have an interest in the vibrant sports scene in Clonakilty and wish to have a different social outlet, so it should be evident in the website that a casual approach to the classes will be accepted. Also suitable for those who wish to write material for others as opposed to performing themselves with sketch-writing and stand-up comedy classes which will be advertised on the website. As this will be the inaugural year of the project, with the founder and facilitator, Joanne Downey having recently completed her MFA and relocated back to her native town, and with the precarious nature of Irish Arts funding (particularly in rural Ireland), it will be important to outline the support via sponsorship of local businesses as well as the support of the local council with the rehearsal/performance space.</p>

<h3><b>How it will be useful to a target audience.</b></h3>

<p>The website will be useful in conveying the potential outcomes/results and rewards of joining the classes (with a description of the show and the scoial aspect) and what is possible to people of the town. The landing page, the <em></em>Welcome page</em>, has some key information about the target group, the location of the classes and the times and content of the classes. It describes the suggested format of the classes, which is adaptable. There isgit add . 
 a navigation section that leads to two other tabs (the Our Mission Page and the Sign-Up page). It will convey the tone of the website.


<p>The 'Our Mission' tab will be very clear and descriptive about what the ethos of 'Pure Drama Limtied' is and what they aspire to achieve. It will also detail the background, experience and qualifications of the lead facilitator, Joanne Downey. This will be very informative to the target audience and the aim of this is to provide them with the conifdence in classes so that they trust them and join. Additionally the 'Ou Mission' page will offer a more general explanation for the content of the five class types, with modern-day celebrities/shows referenced so that the target audience can form an idea of what the overall goal of the classes is.</p>

<p>The third tab, the Sign-Up page, will allow the user to input their details and to declare their preferences in terms of the format (individual/group) and type of class that they are interested in. This information will feed into a database and be very useful to Joanne. Information that will be gathered includes name, email, format of class and type of class. Radio buttons and checkboxes will be used for this effect as well. An omnipresent loading animation has been inserted that has been adjusted to fit in with the color scheme of the website.  Though nothing is loading, the idea with this being present is that it will inspire people to be active in filling out the form and promote action. There is also a feedback box included so direct requests can be communciated to Pure Drama.</p>

<h2><b>FEATURES:</b></h2>
<p>There are a number of existing features included in the website that enhance the user experience. We also have ideas for innovative future features to add once the classes have started that will improve the overall user experience.</p>

<h3><b>EXISTING FEATURES</b></h3>
<p>
<h4>1. Welcome Landing Page:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<h5><b>Feature: Navigation Bar</b></h5>
The value the feature provides: Enables the user to navigate from page to page easily.
What it aims to achieve: This feature will reduce the level of scrolling and divide the website into three different tabs.This is featured on all three tabs for consistency and also to ensure that the user can easily navigate from tab to tab without reverting back to the previous page. The fully responsive navigation bar includes links to the Landing Page denoted as "Welcome", the mission page denoted as "Our Mission" and the sign-up page, denoted as "Sign-Up".
</li>
<li>
<h5><b>Feature: Muted video of applause that autoplays when scrolled over</b></h5>
The value the feature provides: Makes the page more animated, highlights the performance/audience element of the classes, adds to the welcoming atmosphere of the page and creates a sense of energy. 
What it aims to achieve: The user does not have to do anything aside from scroll over the video for it to play automatically. It is also muted to avoid disruption as the audio of the video might be uncomfrtable/unwanted for the user if they are in the library or a quiet area for example or listening to music. it aims to create a welcoming and energetic effect.
</li>
<li>
<h5><b>Feature: Iframe map of Clonakilty</b></h5>
The value the feature provides: Provides the user with an idea of where the classes are located
What it aims to achieve: Creates a visual of the location of the classes so even if the user is not familiar with the town, they can get a general idea of whether the classes are within a commutable distance of their location
</li>
<li>
<h5><b>Feature: Social links that include hyperlinks to the social media that open in a separate tab</b></h5>
The value the feature provides: Though these are generic links currently, the idea is that the personalised facebook, instagram, youtube and twitter pages related to the 'Pure Drama' company will open in separate tabs once these links are selected. This will cause a strong link between the website and all alternative forms of online presence. The facebook and instagram will showcase the amount of public support, with the yotube showing view count and the youtube page will be fully dedciated to long-form videos and demonstrations. The twitter account also will be linked, with daily status updates and the ability to follow the twitter also in place.
What it aims to achieve: Interconnects all online platforms. Creates momentum as if there is a strong presence or following on one platform, it is likely to positively affect the other platforms/inspire people to join the classes/grow people's confidence in the quality of the programme. It also increases the feeling of accessibility as 'Pure Drama' can be communicated with on any of these platforms.
</li>
</ol>
<h4>2. Our Mission Page</h4>
<ol>
<li>
<h5><b>Feature: Navigation tab</b></h5>
The value the feature provides: Contains the same functionality as discussed on the 'Welcome-Landing' page
What it aims to achieve: Makes the website easy to navigate and lends a consistency to each of the separate pages on the website
</li>
<li>
<h5><b>Feature: Social Links</b></h5>
The value the feature provides: Creates the same effect as discussed on Welcome landing page
What it aims to achieve: Lends a consistency to each of the separate pages on the website and creates a link between all online platforms
</li>
<li>Feature: Animation on Joanne Downey's photograph
The value the feature provides:
What it aims to achieve: As this page is the most informative, laden in information, the animation provides light relief and is aesthetically engaging
</li>
<h5><b>3. Sign-Up Page</b></h5>
<ol>
<li>
Feature: Loading spinner
The value the feature provides: Though this animation is usually used to signify loading, I added it as an omnipresent feature on the Sign-Up page that is not connected with loading. 
What it aims to achieve: I did this as I want it to create a sense of momentum and provoke action from the user of the website, who is supposed to be inspired to fill out the 'Sign-Up' form and submit feedback
</li>
<li>
Feature: Responsive picture that changes based on the browser.
The value the feature provided: One image is presented on viewports with max-widths of 699px (e.g. an iphone), a different photo is shown on viewports over 700px (e.g. a laptop). If there is any issue with the brower, a separate image is also included as an alternative
What it aims to achieve: Present alternative photos that are more suited to different viewports (iphone versus laptop) and also offer an alternative image if there is any issue opening these pictures
</li>
<li>
Feature: Field-sets to enter contact details
The value the feature provided: Ability for the user to submit important personal information quickly and safely to the website facilitator
What it aims to achieve: Present an interactive and clearly laid out section where the user can input their name and email address. There fields also change pink when the user clicks on them.
</li>
<li>
Feature: Radio buttons for the type of class the user wants to participate in
The value the feature provided: This will give the website facilitator vital information about the demand of the classes by type
What it aims to achieve: The user can only select one of the three options 'Individual', 'Group' or both so that they don't accidentally sign up for group classes if they solely want individual classes or vice versa. It is also a 'required' feature, so the submit button will not function if an option is not selected
</li>
<li>
Feature: Checkboxes for the style of classes that the user wants to participate in
The value the feature provides: This will provide vital information to the website facilitator about the demand for classes and what classes are popular
What it aims to achieve: The user can select as many styles of classes as they like and the information will be provided to the website facilitator
</li>
<li>
Feature: A feedback box
The value the feature provides: A box where the user can type in any requests that they have or any feedback that they have for the website facilitator. The smaller size of the box is supposed to indicate tha the nature of the feedback at this point is supposed to be concise as the classes have not started yet.
What it aims to achieve: Provide a voice to potential students who would like to request something that is absent on the website/not offered. This feedback will go directly to the facilitator and is not anonymous so can be responded to also. The box becomes highlighted in pink when words are being input, to avoid the user accidentally typing into it and submitting when not intended 
</li>
<li>
Feature: Collapsible contact details widget
The value the feature provides: An interactivw widget feature wherein the user of the website can click on the doropdown to reveal the contact information if they want to
What it aims to achieve: A stylish and comfortable feature that requires action prior to revealing the contact details and that will hide automatically once the page reloads. This will also create a sense of confidence that only people who are interested in the classes/have read through the website will contact the facilitators as opposed to someone who is not serious and just wants to prank email the facilitators
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>><b>FEATURES LEFT TO IMPLEMENT (Future Features)</b></h3>

 <p>
 <ol>
 <li>The intention is to work with a videographer who, with express permission, will record and edit the launch, segments of the classes and the end-of-term performance and a well-edited show reel summary will play on the landing page once available</li>
 <li>There will be an additional audio feature added wherein vox-pop recordings of student testimonials can be played by the user of the website in the 'Student Feedback Dection'. It will be well laid out, revealing the name and age of the students and the testimonials will be divided out by style of class (e.g. drama, comedy, improv etc.). The voiceovers of the testimonials from students will not play automatically once the website is opened, as that may be disruptive and not user-friendly but can be played once the user selects to do so. This will be an interactive feature.</li>
 <li>Once the classes start and the facilitator meets the students and grows to understand their preferences/abilities and needs, the sign-up page will be expanded to garner more information from prospective students (e.g. maybe monologue preferences).</li>
 <li> In the feedback section, weekly polls will be added to get direct feedback from the students in relaiton to the classes.</li>
 <li>A well-styled, responsive gallery page will be added, displaying still images taken from launches, classes and performances. This images will be date stamped and credited accordingly</li>
 </ol>
 </p>

 <h2>TESTING</h2>

 Purpose of this section is to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Go over all project's features and ensure they work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

 I tested the website in a variety of ways to ensure full functionality. This included manual testing (e.g. testing each feature and ensuring that it could complete what it was in place to complete) Additionally, I interacted with developer tools and the lighthouse function to see the code/make updates and to test different viewports. I manually checked the viewports on my phone and laptop also to ensure that the website was fully responsive, as intended. 

   I used different tool to perform the validation testing on the code, as outlined below. I used W3C to est HTML and W3C JIGSAW to test css.

 <h3>Manual Testing of the respsoniveness of the website:</h3>
 1. To different viewports
  I opened the website on my phone and the responsive elements worked accordingly-viewport height, viewport weight and different photos used on differed sizes:
 On my Macbook pro:
 On my Iphone 11:
 On my Apple Watch:

  Responsiveness testing:
  Using developer tools, Jigsaw screenshot:
                            Iphone 11  Macbookpro  Notes
  Site is responsive>=700px   n/a      Good         
  Site is responsive<=700px.  Good     n/a.   When does screen get too small
  Links/URLs:                 Good     Good
  Images work:                Good     Good


 Viewports tested online:

VALIDATOR TESTING:
Interesting bugs and problems discovered whilst testing:

  Addressed:
  Unaddressed bugs and problems: Initially I thought one button could be used to submit all selected answers but it only worked to subnmit the feedback


Bugs:

1. What was the problem?: The sections of the sign-up page only had one submit button for all sections and only one option was allowed to be selected for the radio-button and checkboxes sections combined.
What was the solution?: I divided these out by section and created individual forms for each section to enable them to oeprate separately

2. What was the problem?: The photos in the classes section were not aligning
What was the solution?: I applied relative sizing and inserted left-margin code

3. What was the problem?: Aligning the information in the collapsible widget, the words were scattered and looked messy
What was the solution?: I inserted a table and updated the alignment

4. What was the problem?: The images woudl not load
What was the solution?: The names of the filepaths contained spaces and had to be updated to contain underscores '_' between words

<h2>LIGHTHOUSE</h2>
I accessed the 'LIGHTHOUSE' trsting tool via Developer Tools. Please see a screengrab of the successful lIGHTHOUSE testing below. I believe all %s are adequate:

![alt text](/assets/images/LIGHTHOUSE%20validation.png)


Please see details on the manual testing of all of the features on the website:

1. WELCOME
Video of applause: Is muted as intended, autoplays once scrolled over. Has Adobe Stock stamp but deemed this to be acceptable due to it being a portfolio project as opposed to a professional website
Navigation bar: each navigational word changes color once hovered over, as intended. Each button is fully functional, bringing the user to the intended tab
Social links: Each social link included brings the user to the desired destination in a separate tab once pressed
Map of Clonakilty: The map of the location of the classes is visally displayed using an iframe, as intended. The user can also interact with this iframe by scrolling around in the map

2. MISSION
Joanne Downey image animation:

3. SIGN-UP
Spinner: Successfully continues to load throughout the time on the page. Aligns with the color scheme of the page, as intended
Responsive photo: As intended, the photo changes based on the size of the viewport it is being viewed on
Insert details: User details fields successfully take information typed in and highlight in pink once entered into, to signifiy that they are active
Radio buttons: Radio button class type section is fully operable as a form. Only one of the three buttons can be selected as a time, as intended. Also, it is 'required' so can not be submitted without secltion. Has a unique submission button
Checkboxes: For class style selection. Fully operable as a separate form. Ad intended mroe than one style of class can be selected
Feedback section: Full operable as the user can insert feedback/requests as they please. As intended, box highlighted in pink once selected to signifiy that it is being actively updated. Operates as a separate form with a unique submission button
Contact widget: Noted collapsible widget that has a summary of Contact Pure Drama is successful in open once the triagle is pressed,as intended. The contact information is displayed in a structured, algined table format, as intended

   As then specified on GITHUB, the <em>live link</em> can be found here:

   <b>CREDITS:</b>

   As seen on the website, I drew inspiration from many different sources. i was inspired by the 'Love Running website' in the formatting of some of my features and used many different sources referenced in the tutorials for the images and content. Please see credits below for content and images/videos.:

   <b>CONTENT:</b>

   -Text for homepage was taken from ''
   -Icons beside the text throughout the website and in the footer were taken from Font Awesome

   <b>MEDIA:</b>

User Experience:

Brainstorm: 

I brainstormed this idea by thinking about what type of website would be ideal for the goal that I have in mind: A minimum viable product that is well done and doesn't negate from the website due to lack of Javascript etc. I decided to go with a theme that I knew would work well from looking at the lectures (the first portfolio project/Love Running etc) As I am a Drama graduate who has taught a variety of performance-based classes at different venues, I felt that this would be suitable as my first project as I had the required expertise needed to disclose the information needed and knew that the theme was entertaining enough in itself.

I brainstormed the shape of the website by using Balsimiq which was made readily available to students of the Code institute. Please see screengrabs of Balsimiq below:

BALSIMIQ BRAINSTORM:

For this first project, which is heavily focussed on design, I wanted to create a solid minimum viable product as opposed to being overly ambitious and adding too much and making everything messy. I wanted to have clear features that were easy to navigate and fulfilled the function that they were there for. 

I beleive that the wEBsite is very user friendly, it is respeonsive and interactive, clearly laid out and accesible as it contains alts and aria-labels for screen readers.

I considered the five planes of user experience when designing my website: Strategy Plane, Scope Plane, Structure Plane, Skeleton Plane and the Surface pLANE.

Please see how I considered these below:

1. Strategy Plane: I needed to consider viability and usability as well as my limited resources and skillset considering this would be my first ever project. For it's purpose, the content is culturally appropriate and the content can be tracked in an intuitive way. The business goal of the website is to increase the awarness of the classes and to build a positive reportuation. Tech condi=sideration-website must appeal to tweens and teens and appeal ot their interest in facebook/twitter/youtube and instagram. The goal with the feedback form is to assist in the development of the website to make it more appealing to the user. It's a B2C website. Accordingly, I have made an affort to make the website catchy and appealing, with use of large images.

  In the research phases I decided this website would be worth doing as I would be informed.
What value can be provided to the demographic of tweens and teens and their parents
  
  
  Viability and Feasibility (have skills, resources, time to implement features) versus Importance (business goals and user needs). Deciding on what to keep and not to keep.

  List and rate opportunities 1-5 in terms of dimensions importance versus viability and feasability
  Broken into opportunities and problems to be solved

  -Create online presence
  -Make group known in the town and beyond
  -Showcase experience and qualifications
  -Detail sponsorships and present payment plan opportunity

  (sum of importance/average viability*number items
  )

  Competitive-offering wide variety of versatile classes, over several days with option to learn in groups or alone, feedback form and payment plans available-affordable.

2. Scope Plane:

What features of business/user needs needed
Agile approach-small bitesze increments of development
Minimal documentation-features simpl and schedule controllable

 new ideas for future features-suture releases

 sprint-duration of time committed to buidling something-rarely over one month

 If scope is too big, not meet deadlines, release date, commitment-was worried about that

 Avoid scope creep (adding random new features too late)
 Don't want scope too small-unimpressive products

 Requirements

 What users need
 What they actually need
 What they don't know they need

 Difference between imagining how something will be used and how it will actually be used

 Brainstorm-explore-discuss

 Requirement types

 Content requirements

 Mixed content used in our website-images, video

 Requirement categories-types: Useful, Sellable, Buildable

 Useful-yes website informs potential customrs
 Sellable-

 Objective-Functional-Non-functional-Business rules

 Objective-what does user want to accomplish
 Functional-What does user need to do to accomplish pbjective
 Non-functional-contraints website has. Scaleable:as user base grows, can application handle gorwth in traffic

 Business rules: What dynamic constraints do we have to meet?

 Product is a virtual representation of business

 User story-how user interacts with system

3. Structure Plane:

Organisation of functionality and content. Navigating through in a functional way.

Categories of information-sections

Info presentation and organisation-intuitive

Interaction Design

Structure and behavior of interactive systems

Meaning for rleationships elements-content, information

Functionality and interactivity

Reduces risk of user error,makes user aware of state chnages

-Site is consistent, predictable , learnable, visible and clear feedback (navigation bar and social links on every page)
-Interactive features consistent in colouring
-Scenario: Transitions, rollover, tool clips behave consistently
- Consistency of voice-lablels and terms. Content and imagery, stable and consistent style

Only different when enhances experience-e.g. pink submission buttons in 'Sign-Up' page

-Intuitive, single -trial learning, sitck to conventions

<b>Information Architecture</b>

Creation of organisational and navigational schemas

Principles of organisation

-Information Architecture -Visual vocabulary 


4. Skeleton Plane:

Naviagtion design and interface design

Design work-what form will application take
How will users get around how we present content

Give form to function
Establish value in users mind

<h1>PURE DRAMA FOR TWEENS AND TEENS</h1>

<h2><em>Provisional Introduction</em><h2>

<b>-What the project hopes to accomplish.</b>
 <p>The aim of the website is to advertise newly launched performance-based classes for tweens and teens in Clonakilty. The website is in association with 'Pure Drama Limited', a newly establised company of the facilitator/website owner in question, Joanne Downey. Having graduated with an Honors degree in 'Drama and Theatre Studies' and an MFA in Playwriting, Joanne has launched her own company 'Pure Drama' with her husband, Michael Downey and the pair are launching classes in their native town of Clonakilty The website should successfully display what is on offer with the classes (content/format), describe who the facilitator/teacher is as well outline the mission of the newly established company and describe what their relevant experience/qualifications are. The site should also indicate towards the format of the end-of-term shows and highlight how the cast/crew will be sourced from the classes but that it is not mandatory for the people in the class to participate in the show. The content and location of the classes should be presented. With the design, it should be concisely outlined how the classes can be offered one-on-one or to groups, what times are available and what will be involved with the classes. There will be an interactive, responsive page also which allows the user of the website to input their details and preferences.</p>

<b>Who the project is targetting.</b>

<p>The project is targetting the parents of tweens and teens, as well as the tweens and teens in the locality who are looking to make better use of their spare time or to experiment with different styles of performance (comedy, stand up, improvisation, monologe, duologue, hosting etc.) The classes are suitable for those who wish to perform in the end of term show, which will be open for the attendance of the general public but equally suitable to those who do not wish to perform at all and who simply want to attend on a casual basis/to gain confidence in their own lives and this should be conveyed in the website. Potentially, the classes could offer an alternative to locals who do not have an interest in the vibrant sports scene in Clonakilty and wish to have a different social outlet, so it should be evident in the website that a casual approach to the classes will be accepted. Also suitable for those who wish to write material for others as opposed to performing themselves with sketch-writing and stand-up comedy classes which will be advertised on the website. As this will be the inaugural year of the project, with the founder and facilitator, Joanne Downey having recently completed her MFA and relocated back to her native town, and with the precarious nature of Irish Arts funding (particularly in rural Ireland), it will be important to outline the support via sponsorship of local businesses as well as the support of the local council with the rehearsal/performance space.</p>

<b>How it will be useful to a target audience.</b>

<p>The website will be useful in conveying the potential outcomes/results and rewards of joining the classes (with a description of the show and the scoial aspect) and what is possible to people of the town. The landing page, the <em></em>Welcome page</em>, has some key information about the target group, the location of the classes and the times and content of the classes. It describes the suggested format of the classes, which is adaptable. There is a navigation section that leads to two other tabs (the Our Mission Page and the Sign-Up page). It will convey the tone of the website.


The 'Our Mission' tab will be very clear and descriptive about what the ethos of 'Pure Drama Limtied' is and what they aspire to achieve. It will also detail the background, experience and qualifications of the lead facilitator, Joanne Downey. This will be very informative to the target audience and the aim of this is to provide them with the conifdence in classes so that they trust them and join. Additionally the 'Ou Mission' page will offer a more general explanation for the content of the five class types, with modern-day celebrities/shows referenced so that the target audience can form an idea of what the overall goal of the classes is. 

The third tab, the Sign-Up page, will allow the user to input their details and to declare their preferences in terms of the format (individual/group) and type of class that they are interested in. This information will feed into a database and be very useful to Joanne. Information that will be gathered includes name, email, format of class and type of class. Radio buttons and checkboxes will be used for this effect as well. An omnipresent loading animation has been inserted that has been adjusted to fit in with the color scheme of the website.  Though nothing is loading, the idea with this being present is that it will inspire people to be active in filling out the form and promote action. There is also a feedback box included so direct requests can be communciated to Pure Drama.</p>

The smaller size of the box is supposed to indicate tha the nature of the feedback at this point is supposed to be concise as the classes have not start yet.
What it aims to achieve: Provide a voice to potential students who would like to request something that is absent on the website/not offered. This feedback will go directly to the facilitator and is not anonymous so can be responded to also. The box becomes highlighted in pink when words are being input, to avoid the user accidentally typing into it and submitting when not intended 
</li>
<li>
Feature: Collapsible contact details widget
The value the feature provides: An interactivw widget feature wherein the user of the website can click on the doropdown to reveal the contact information if they want to

This will also create a sense of confidence that only people who are interested in the classes/have read through the website will contact the facilitators as opposed to someone who is not serious and just wants to prank email the facilitators
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<b>Features left to implement (Future Features)</b>

 <p>
 <ol>The intention is to work with a videographer who, with express permission, will record and edit the launch, segments of the classes and the end-of-term performance and a well-edited show reel summary will play on the landing page once available
 -There will be an additional audio feature added wherein vox-pop recordings of student testimonials can be played by the user of the website in the 'Student Feedback Dection'. It will be well laid out, revealing the name and age of the student and the testimonials will be divided out by style of class. The voiceovers of the testimonials from students will not play automatically once the website is opened, as that may be disruptive and not user-friendly but can be played once the user selects to do so. This will be an interactive feature.
 -Once the classes start and the facilitator meets the students and grows to understand their preferences/abilities and needs, the sign-up page will be expanded to garner more information from prospective students (e.g. maybe monologue preferences). Weekly polls will be added to get direct feedback from the studentsin relaiton to the classes
 -A well-styled gallery page will be added, displaying still images taken from launches, classes and performances. This images will be date stamped and credited accordingly
 </ol>

PURE DRAMA FOR TWEENS AND TEENS

Provisional Introduction:

-What the project hopes to accomplish.
 The aim of the website is to advertise newly launched classes in Clonakilty. The website is in association with 'Pure Drama Limited', a newly establised company of the facilitator/website owner in question, Joanne Downey. Having graduated with an Honors degree in 'Drama and Theatre Studies' and an MFA in Playwriting, Joanne has launched her own company 'Pure Mule' with her husband, Michael Downey and the pair are launching classes in their native town of Clonakilty The website should successfully display what is on offer with the classes (content/format), describe who the facilitator/teacher is as well as the newly established company and what their relevant experience/qualifications are and describe the format of the end-of-term shows and what the students could aim to participate in. The content and location of the classes should be presented. With the design, it should be concisely outlined how the classes can be offered one-on-one or to groups, what times are available and what will be involved with the classes. There will be an interactive, responsive page also which allows the user of the website to input their details and preferences.

-Who the project is targetting.

The project is targetting the parents of tweens and teens, as well as the tweens and teens in the locality who are looking to make better use of their spare time or to experiment with different styles of performance (comedy, stand up, improvisation, monologe, duologue, hsoting etc.) The classes are suitable for those who wish to perform in the end of term show, which will be open for the attendance of the general public but equally suitable to those who do not wish to perform at all or who simply want to attend on a casual basis/to gain confidence in their own lives and this should be conveyed in the website. Potentially, the classes could offer an alternative to locals who do not have an interest in the vibrant sports scene in Clonakilty and wish to have a different social outlet, so it should be evident in the website that a casual approach will be accepted.. Also suitable for those who wish to write material for others as opposed to performing themselves with sketch-writing and stand-up comedy classes which will be advertised on the website. As this will be the inaugural year of the project, with the founder and facilitator, Joanne Downey having recently completed her MFA ns relocated back to her native town, and with the precarious nature of Irish Arts funding (particularly in rural Ireland), it will be important to outline the support via sponsorship of local businesses as well as the support of the local council with the rehearsal/performance space.

-How it will be useful to a target audience.
The website will be useful in conveying the potential outcomes/results and rewards of joining the classes (with a description of the show and the scoial aspect) and what is possible to people of the town. The landing page will have some key information about the target group, the location of the classes, the times and content of the classes. It will describe the suggested format of the classes, which is adaptable. There will be a navigation section that leads to two other tabs (the Our Mission Page and the Sign-Up page). It will convey the tone of the website.


The 'Our Mission' tab will be very clear and descriptive about what the overall goal of the classes is and what the ethos of 'Pure Drama Limtied' is. It will also detail the background, experience and qualifications of the lead facilitator, Joanne Downey. This will be very informative to the target audience and the aim of this is to provide them with the conifdence in classes so that they trust them and join. Additionally the 'Ou Mission' page will offer a more general explanation for the content of the five class types, with modern-day celebrities referenced so the target audience can form an idea of what the overall goal of the classes is. 

The Sign Up page, will allow the user to input their details and to declare their preferences in terms of the format (individual/group) and tpye of class that they are interested in. This information will feed into a database and be very useful to Joanne. Information that will be gathered includes area of name, email, format of class and type of class. Radio buttons and checkboxes will be used for this effect as well. An omnipresent loading animation has been inserted that has been adjusted to fit in with the color scheme of the website.  Though nothing is loading,t he idea with this being present is that it will inspire people to be active in filling out the form and promote action.
